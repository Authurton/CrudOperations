API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/products	Get a list of all products
GET	/api/products/{id}	Get a specific product by ID
POST	/api/products	Create a new product
PUT	/api/products/{id}	Update an existing product
DELETE	/api/products/{id}	Delete a product

Request and Response Format
The API accepts and returns JSON-formatted data. Here's an example of a product object:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product A",
  "price": 9.99,
  "quantity": 50
}

Error Handling
The API includes proper error handling and validation. If a request is invalid or a resource is not found, 
the API will return the appropriate HTTP status code and an error message, like this:
{
  "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": {
    "Name": [
      "The Name field is required."
    ],
    "Price": [
      "The Price field must be between 0 and 1000."
    ]
  }
}

Security Considerations
The API includes the following security measures:

Input validation to prevent SQL injection and other common vulnerabilities.
HTTPS (when deployed to production) to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
Rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
Versioning
The current version of the API is v1. If future versions are released, they will be accessible at different endpoints (e.g., /api/v2/products).

Future Enhancements
Planned future enhancements for the API include:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Add support for filtering, sorting, and paging the product list.
Integrate with a message queue for asynchronous processing of product-related tasks.
